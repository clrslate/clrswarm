_The open-source "bee colony" that assembles MCP Gateways, Kubernetes Operators, and next-gen AI automations‚Äîone modular cell at a time._

**ClrSwarm** is part of the **ClrSlate** platform and represents our contribution to the community. These are the battle-tested tools that have helped us build and scale our infrastructure, and we hope they'll help others in the community as well.

_We will be gradually making our internal tooling public over the next couple of months, starting with ClrSwarm's core components._

## What is ClrSwarm?

**ClrSwarm** is the developer toolkit of the **ClrSlate** application suite.  
It gives platform engineers a fast, opinionated way to generate, test, and ship:

| Area                       | Built-in Power                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **‚öôÔ∏è Kubernetes Operator** | Automates MCP orchestration at scale on Kubernetes. Manages the full lifecycle of MCP server deployments, scaling, and configuration through declarative CRDs and reconciliation loops.                                                                        |
| **ü§ñ Agentic Extensions**  | AI-powered automation capabilities that can consume any MCP server. Available in A2A (Agent-to-Agent) format for seamless integration with existing workflows and decision-making pipelines.                                                                   |
| **üß© Add-On Ecosystem**    | Clear interface contracts so teams can drop in auth, observability, or policy drivers without fork-lifting.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **üöÄ DevX Toolbelt**       | CLI, schematics, and VS Code snippets that let you prototype in minutes and release with confidence.                                                                                                                                                           |

## Why "Swarm"?

Like a hive of cooperative bees, ClrSwarm's modules work in concert:

- **Swarm, don't sprawl** ‚Äì keep logic in focused, reusable units.
- **Self-healing** ‚Äì operators reconcile desired state just as bees rebuild a damaged comb.
- **Collective intelligence** ‚Äì agentic helpers learn and optimise pipelines over time.

## Core Components

### üõ£Ô∏è MCP Gateway

The **MCP Gateway** solves the critical problem of **tool sprawl** when working with multiple Model Context Protocol servers. Instead of managing dozens of individual MCP servers, the gateway:

- **Consolidates multiple MCP servers** into a single HTTP streamable endpoint
- **Selective tool exposure** - pick and choose which tools from each server to expose publicly
- **Universal compatibility** - works with any MCP server, including stdio transport-based servers
- **Built-in pipeline** for observability, distributed tracing, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns
- **Container-ready** - can be hosted on any container runtime for maximum deployment flexibility

**Use case**: Turn 15 different MCP servers into one unified API that your applications can consume, while maintaining fine-grained control over which capabilities are exposed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Kubernetes Operator

The **Kubernetes Operator** brings enterprise-grade automation to MCP orchestration at scale:

- **Declarative MCP management** through Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- **Full lifecycle automation** - deployment, scaling, configuration, and updates of MCP servers
- **Reconciliation loops** that ensure your desired MCP topology matches reality
- **Day-2 operations** - automated backup, monitoring, and disaster recovery
- **Multi-tenant support** with namespace isolation and resource quotas

**Use case**: Deploy and manage hundreds of MCP servers across multiple environments with GitOps workflows, automatic scaling, and zero-downtime updates.

### ü§ñ Agentic Extensions

The **Agentic Extensions** layer adds AI-powered automation that can consume any MCP server:

- **Universal MCP consumption** - agents can work with any MCP server in your ecosystem
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol** for seamless integration between automated systems
- **Workflow automation** - intelligent decision-making based on real-time data from MCP tools
- **Learning pipelines** - agents improve over time by analyzing successful automation patterns
- **Event-driven architecture** - reactive automation that responds to changes in your infrastructure

**Use case**: Create intelligent automation that can read logs via one MCP server, analyze trends via another, and automatically scale resources through a third - all coordinated through agent-to-agent communication.
